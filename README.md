# SDL2-CPP-Typing-Game
Typing game application built using SDL2 graphics library and C++. The goal is to type the maximum number of words before a word reaches the other side of the screen and you lose. 

To run, download SDL2 and SDL2_TTF and link them appropiately. You will need to also download a txt. file to display whatever words you wish to have appear. For this project, I used the text file found at https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt.
